 series={Endangered Species}, title={Pollinators in Peril: A Systematic Status Review of North American and Hawaiian Native Bees}, abstractNote={While the decline of European honeybees in the United States and beyond has beenwell publicized in recent years, the more than 4,000 species of native bees in North America and Hawaii have been much less documented. Although these native bees are not as well known as honeybees, they play a vital role in functioning ecosystems and also provide more than $3 billion dollars in fruit-pollination services each year just in the United States. For this first-of-its-kind analysis, the Center for Biological Diversity conducted a systematic review of the status of all 4,337 North American and Hawaiian native bees. Our key findings: • Among native bee species with sufficient data to assess (1,437), more than half (749) are declining. • Nearly 1 in 4 (347 native bee species) is imperiled and at increasing risk of extinction. • For many of the bee species lacking sufficient population data, it’s likely they are also declining or at risk of extinction. Additional research is urgently needed to protect them. • A primary driver of these declines is agricultural intensification, which includes habitat destruction and pesticide use. Other major threats are climate change and urbanization. These troubling findings come as a growing body of research has revealed that more than 40 percent of insect pollinators globally are highly threatened, including many of the native bees critical to unprompted crop and wildflower pollination across the United States. For this report we assembled a list of all valid native bee species and their current conservation status as established by state, federal or independent researchers. We then conducted a comprehensive review of all literature on those species as well as records documenting their occurrence. From that research we identified those bees with sufficient data to assess their status, including current and historical range, behavioral observations and studies, arriving at the first comprehensive analysis of the status of North American and Hawaiian native bees. We also highlight five native solitary bee species that are seriously imperiled. These remarkable, underappreciated pollinators offer a snapshot of the threats driving the alarming declines in many native bee species — declines that must be reversed to save these irreplaceable native bees and the health of the ecosystems that depend on them.}, author={Kopec, Kelsey and Burd, Lori Ann}, year={2017}, month={Feb}, pages={15}, collection={Endangered Species}, language={en} }

To examine how the conservation planning literature addresses biological invasions and if planning in the marine environment could benefit from experiences in the freshwater and terrestrial systems, we conducted a global systematic review. Out of 1,149 scientific articles mentioning both “conservation planning” and “alien” or any of its alternative terms, 70 articles met our selection criteria. Most of the studies were related to the terrestrial environment, while only 10% focused on the marine environment. The main conservation targets were species (mostly vertebrates) rather than habitats or ecosystems. Apart from being mentioned, alien species were considered of concern for conservation in only 46% of the cases, while mitigation measures were proposed in only 13% of the cases. The vast majority of the studies (73%) ignored alien species in conservation planning even if their negative impacts were recognized. In 20% of the studies, highly invaded areas were avoided in the planning, while in 6% of the cases such areas were prioritized for conservation. In the latter case, two opposing approaches led to the selection of invaded areas: either alien and native biodiversity were treated equally in setting conservation targets, i.e., alien species were also considered as ecological features requiring protection, or more commonly invaded sites were prioritized for the implementation of management actions to control or eradicate invasive alien species. When the “avoid” approach was followed, in most of the cases highly impacted areas were either excluded or invasive alien species were included in the estimation of a cost function to be minimized. Most of the studies that followed a “protect” or “avoid” approach dealt with terrestrial or freshwater features but in most cases the followed approach could be transferred to the marine environment. Gaps and needs for further research are discussed and we propose an 11-step framework to account for biological invasions into the systematic conservation planning design.}, journal={Frontiers in Marine Science}, author={Mačić, Vesna and Albano, Paolo G. and Almpanidou, Vasiliki and Claudet, Joachim and Corrales, Xavier and Essl, Franz and Evagelopoulos, Athanasios and Giovos, Ioannis and Jimenez, Carlos and Kark, Salit and Marković, Olivera and Mazaris, Antonios D. and Ólafsdóttir, Guðbjörg Á. and Panayotova, Marina and Petović, Slavica and Rabitsch, Wolfgang and Ramdani, Mohammed and Rilov, Gil and Tricarico, Elena and Vega Fernández, Tomás and Sini, Maria and Trygonis, Vasilis and Katsanevakis, Stelios}, year={2018} }

To date research in this area has focused on how invasive plant species affect pollinator behaviour, but there is a lack of data on the impact that alien plant species have on wild pollinator populations. Since their introduction in the 19th century, and rapid spread after the 1950s, alien goldenrods (Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea) have been among the most successful invasive plant species in Europe. We studied the effects of goldenrods on wild pollinator communities in SE Poland. The abundance, species richness and diversity of wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies were compared between wet meadows invaded by goldenrod (10 transects) and non-invaded controls (10 transects). Furthermore, we compared the plant diversity and average cover between the two groups of sites. Invasion of goldenrods had a very strong negative effect on wild pollinator diversity as well as abundance. Plant diversity and average cover were also negatively affected by goldenrod invasion. Wild pollinators were grouped according to their nesting and food specialization, but none were resistant to the invasion, indicating that introduced goldenrod may affect the entire wild pollinator community. Our study emphasises the urgent need to develop specific protection plans for wild pollinators in habitats threatened by foreign plants and we call for the introduction of programs to stop the invasion of goldenrod not only in Poland, but also on a continental scale.}, number={7}, journal={Biological Conservation}, author={Moroń, Dawid and Lenda, Magdalena and Skórka, Piotr and Szentgyörgyi, Hajnalka and Settele, Josef and Woyciechowski, Michal}, year={2009}, month={Jul}, pages={1322–1332}, language={en} }

 title={Invader–pollinator paradox: Invasive goldenrods benefit from large size pollinators}, volume={27}, ISSN={1472-4642}, DOI={10.1111/ddi.13221}, abstractNote={Aim Mutualistic interactions between alien plants and native pollinators are needed to enable plant invasions. Although the increasing abundance of invasive plants in a habitat causes a dramatic decline of native pollinators, pollination services received by invaders are often sustained. This invader–pollinator paradox might be attributed to differences in pollination effectiveness and varying vulnerability to invasion among pollinators with different life history traits. In an experimental study, we explored the relationships between pollinator body size, pollination effectiveness and abundance of invasive species. Location Kraków area, Poland. Methods We placed a pair of potted invasive goldenrods (Solidago gigantea) at 25 sites differing in goldenrod abundance (cover: 0%–100%). Floral visitation rate of the potted goldenrods, as well as seed set and viability, was noted. Results Species richness of pollinators visiting inflorescences decreased with the increase of the goldenrod cover, whereas the floral visitation rate remained unchanged. However, the seed set was positively related to the goldenrod cover. Body size of floral visitors was structured along with the goldenrod cover so that pollinators’ size increased with the cover. Also, the seed set of the potted plants, as well as goldenrod seed viability, depended positively on the body size of visiting pollinators. Main conclusions Invasive goldenrods did not suffer from pollinator shortage and ineffective pollination, especially in habitats densely covered by the invader, due to the presence of large-bodied pollinators. Our study highlights that pollination and reproduction of invasive plants might be sustained through ecological filtering, affecting the composition of pollinators with traits increasing pollination effectiveness.}, number={4}, journal={Diversity and Distributions}, author={Moroń, Dawid and Marjańska, Emilia and Skórka, Piotr and Lenda, Magdalena and Woyciechowski, Michał}, year={2021}, pages={632–641}, language={en} }

The impact of invading species on communities may be either linearly or non-linearly related to the invaders’ abundance in a habitat. However, non-linear relationships with a threshold point at which the community can no longer tolerate the invasive species without loss of ecosystem functions remains poorly studied. We selected 31 wet meadow sites that encompassed the entire coverage spectrum of invasive goldenrods, and surveyed the abundance and diversity of pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hover flies) and native plants. The species richness of native plants decreased linearly with goldenrod cover, whereas the abundance and species richness of bees and butterflies decreased non-linearly with increasing goldenrod cover. However, no statistically significant changes across goldenrod cover were noted for the abundance and species richness of hover flies. Because of the non-linear response, goldenrod had no visible impact on bees and butterflies until it reached cover in a habitat of about 50% and 30–40%, respectively. Moreover, changes driven by goldenrod in the plant and pollinator communities were related to species loss rather than species replacement. We demonstrated that the impact of goldenrod cover on a habitat is not instantaneous. Habit management aimed at preventing the invasion process and alleviating its impact should take into account that, for the non-linear relationships, the negative impact can appear rapidly after crossing the threshold point.}, number={3}, journal={Biological Invasions}, author={Moroń, Dawid and Skórka, Piotr and Lenda, Magdalena and Kajzer-Bonk, Joanna and Mielczarek, Łukasz and Rożej-Pabijan, Elżbieta and Wantuch, Marta}, year={2019}, month={Mar}, pages={947–960}, language={en} }

This diversity partly reflects healthy differences in objectives, backgrounds of planners, and assumptions about data and conservation priorities. Diversity also has disadvantages, including confusion among donors and prospective conservation planners about what to fund and how to plan. To help reduce this confusion, we compared approaches described in separate articles by four major conservation NGOs. We structured our comparison with an 11-stage framework for conservation planning. We found considerable agreement between approaches in their recognition and ways of addressing many planning stages. The approaches diverged most obviously in ways of collecting socio-economic and biodiversity data and identifying explicit conservation objectives. Even here, however, the approaches tend to be complementary and there is potential to combine them in many landscapes and seascapes. Our review emphasizes that systematic methods are having real benefits in guiding effective conservation investments. We finish by outlining two challenges for conservation planning generally: (1) managing the transition from planning to applying conservation actions, and (2) assessing the costs and benefits of conservation planning.}, number={4}, journal={Oryx}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Pressey, Robert L. and Bottrill, Madeleine C.}, year={2009}, month={Oct}, pages={464–475}, language={en} }

We argue that ecosystem service management does not equal biodiversity conservation, and that maintaining species diversity is crucial in providing ecosystem resilience in the face of future environmental change. Management and policy measures therefore need to focus on species not just in human dominated landscapes but need to benefit wider diversity of species including those in specialised habitats.
